# Dental Health in Youth

This repository contains my first SpringBoard Capstone Project.

## Summary: 
The goal of this project is to build models to estimate and predict tooth issues using many demographic factors for physicians and organizations who want to understand what kind of demographics and conditions that contribute to dental issues in children. This project will be utilizing clustering methods to group similar countries together. 

## Code:

[Data Wrangling](https://github.com/SilasNeptune/Dental-Health-in-Youth/blob/master/CleanData.ipynb) : Reading and cleaning of the demographics data. All files are CSV files and contained missing values and formatting issues.


[Exploratory Data Analysis](https://github.com/SilasNeptune/Dental-Health-in-Youth/blob/master/EDA_and_Inferential_Statistics.ipynb) : Exploring different trends in each variable along with correlations and trends among them. Using graphs and tables to get a better understanding of the world's distributions.


[Machine Learning](https://github.com/SilasNeptune/Dental-Health-in-Youth/blob/master/Machine%20Learning.ipynb) : Using two different clustering methods to group countries and comparing results.
